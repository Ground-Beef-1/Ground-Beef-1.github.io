#Client meeting1

I spoke with her and it became apparent that she had the idea that she would 
say 'website please' and I would conjure up the perfect website without any
of her input. She was super wrong. She has no clue what she wants, I may have bit off more than I can chew... The only reason it took this long to meet with 
my own mom about her website is because she was super busy, but if she gave me
some sort of framework i would be able to stand such a late first meeting. 
Either way, she is now procrastinating on figuring out what she wants even 
though I walked her through everything and tried to draw a mockup, but she did 
not like any that I drew, leading her to decide that she will draw it herself
later. Later has not yet come. We perservere.
