# The TCP/IP Model

the model has four layers

## Application

This guy is how you see everything like images, games, websites, and even 
images.

Protocols here include:

- WWW
- Email
- VoIP
- SMS
- IRC

## Transport

The transport layer is where you choose between speed or accuracy (you can 
never have both) where real-time things choose speed and anything else chooses
 accuracy.

Protocols here include:

- TCP (the accurate one)
- UDP (the speedy one)

## Internet

The internet(work) layer is where your IP adress lives

Protocols (I think) here include:

- IP adress

## Link (Network Access)

This freak is where the 5G that causes autism resides as well as other things
that you know.

Protocols in this layer include:

- Wifi
- Bluetooth
- LTE
- Ethernet
